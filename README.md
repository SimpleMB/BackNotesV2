### What is BackNotes?

BackNotes is an app that will **help you make notes** in markdown language.

Your notes can be easly **parsed to HTML** web page.

You can read your notes here in app or **download** them on your pc or mac.

**Purpose** for creating BackNotes was to write notes when learning Frontend and Backend technologies.

I wanted to store and **quickly access key functionalties** of technology for future reference and also **copy/paste code snippets**.
